# Mini-Project-Detection-Of-Offensive-Messages-In-Social-Media
Made for Sfit Mini project sem 3


The proliferation of social media has created dynamic platforms for communication but has also introduced significant challenges related to online safety and the prevalence of offensive messages. This project, "Detection of Offensive Messages in Social Media to Protect Online Safety," aims to address these challenges by developing a robust system capable of identifying and mitigating harmful content. Utilizing NodeJS,ExpressJS for backend development and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, along with MongoDB for database management, the system integrates advanced filtering techniques and user-driven customization to effectively detect and manage offensive messages.
